# Target Propagation through Layer Inverses
The present code implements an ideal formulation of Target Propagation using regularized inverses
computed analytically rather than using some reverse layer optimized to approximate the inverse.

The code focuses on Recurrent Neural Networks for which vanishing/exploding gradients phenomena are known to impede the performance of a classical gradient back-propagation formula. The experiments demonstrate that TP may be beneficial for optimizing long sequences with RNNs.

The main part of the code consisted in modifying the structure of classical RNNs by adding a target_prop function
in the definition of the RNN, see ``src/model/rnn.py``.
The optimization is done in ``src/optim/run_optimizer.py``.
The following code is provided to reproduce the plots in the paper.


## Setup
Create a conda environment and activate it  
``conda create -n target_prop python=3.8``  
``conda activate target_prop``

Install dependencies  
``conda install seaborn matplotlib pandas``

For PyTorch, the installation depends on your OS. For Mac for example, use  
``conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch``

## Setup PythonPath
Add the parent directory to the PYTHONPATH environment variable: </br>
For Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS): </br>
`export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/parent_directory`

For Windows: </br>
`set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\path\to\parent_directory`

Replace `/path/to/parent_directory` or `C:\path\to\parent_directory` with the actual path to your parent directory.

**Other way is using `sys` module** </br>
```
import sys
import os

# Get the current script's directory
current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
```

## Experiments
To reproduce the plots presented in the paper run from the folder exp   
``python paper_conv_plots.py``
``python heatmap_reg_stepsize.py``
``python heatmap_perf.py``
``python sensitivity_analysis.py``
``python grad_behavior.py``

The file ``exp_rnn.py`` illustrates a simple pipeline for an experiment on RNNs. The code is composed of data
 generation in ``src/data/get_data.py``, model definition in ``src/model/make_model.py`` and optimization in ``src/optim
 /run_optimizer.py``. They are wrapped in the function ``exp/exp_neck.py`` that is further used with pipeline tools
  presented in the folder ``utils_pipeline``
